    <p>
      <strong>Leadership & Doctrine</strong> is exmxc.ai’s institutional thought library — a governed body of essays
      examining how leadership, strategy, and organizational identity are being reinterpreted in the AI-search era.
    </p>

    <p>
      These writings focus on structural clarity, entity interpretation, and the discipline of building institutions
      that remain legible to both humans and machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each piece is authored as doctrine — not commentary — offering durable perspectives for leaders navigating
      systems, institutions, and technological transitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Canonical essays are published on exmxc.ai.</em>

    <h2>Authority & Stewardship</h2>
    <p>
      Leadership & Doctrine reflects the judgment and institutional perspective of exmxc’s founder and steward.
      These essays establish the human authority from which exmxc’s standards, frameworks, and analytical systems derive.
