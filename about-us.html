    <h1>exmxc — Strategic Intelligence Institution</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>exmxc is a strategic intelligence institution.</strong>
      It analyzes how AI-mediated discovery reshapes institutional value,
      competitive positioning, and long-horizon decision leverage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution studies how AI-search systems interpret entities,
      narratives, and categories — and how those interpretations affect
      strategy, acquisition logic, integration risk, and durable advantage
      across modern markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      exmxc operates as an institutional doctrine and operating layer.
      Human judgment remains primary. AI systems are used as instrumentation
      to observe, pressure-test, and detect interpretive drift.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>TrailGenic</strong> operates as an applied laboratory
      governed by exmxc. Laboratories do not define institutional doctrine.
      They operate under it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The canonical institutional definition and hierarchy are maintained at:
