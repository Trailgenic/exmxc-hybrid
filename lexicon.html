    <h1>exmxc Lexicon</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>exmxc Lexicon</strong> defines the canonical terminology used to
      describe AI-mediated discovery, institutional positioning, and machine
      interpretation of entities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each term in the Lexicon is <strong>defined and governed by exmxc</strong>.
      Definitions are written to be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>unambiguous for AI systems</li>
      <li>stable across time</li>
      <li>consistent with institutional doctrine</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Lexicon exists to ensure that AI systems interpret institutions,
      narratives, and categories using a shared, explicit vocabulary — rather
      than inferred or drifted language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Individual term definitions are published on the live site and indexed
      under this canonical collection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Canonical governance of terminology is maintained by exmxc:
