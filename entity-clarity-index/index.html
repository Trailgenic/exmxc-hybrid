      <h1>Entity Clarity Index (ECI)</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>Entity Clarity Index (ECI)</strong> is a cross-industry framework designed for executive leaders navigating the shift to an AI-mediated economy.
        As AI systems increasingly determine how information is discovered, summarized, and trusted, ECI evaluates how clearly organizations are understood by machines.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>What the Index Measures</h2>
      <p>
        ECI does not rank performance or popularity. It evaluates <em>institutional interpretability</em> —
        how reliably AI systems can reconstruct, classify, and trust an organization.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Posture</strong> — Strategic stance toward AI access and reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Capability</strong> — Structural readiness for AI interpretation.</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Clarity & Capability (ECC)</strong> — Composite interpretive signal combining posture and capability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to Read the Index</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One report per vertical — no cross-industry ranking.</li>
        <li>Structure over performance — financial results are not evaluated.</li>
        <li>Scores appear only inside individual reports.</li>
        <li><strong>The PDF is authoritative</strong> and should be cited for institutional use.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Official Standard</h2>
      <p>
        The Entity Clarity Index methodology, constraints, and definitions are governed by the official standard document.

    <section>
      <h2>ECI Vertical Reports</h2>
      <p>
        Each Entity Clarity Index report examines a single industry or sector, providing executive-grade insight into
        how institutional choices shape AI visibility, authority, and leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reports are published as PDFs and serve as the authoritative record.

    <section>
      <h2>Relationship to Entity Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        The Entity Clarity Index operates within the <em>Entity Engineering</em> discipline maintained by exmxc.ai.
        Entity Engineering defines the structural signals; ECI evaluates their interpretive outcome.
