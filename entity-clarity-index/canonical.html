    <h1>Entity Clarity Index (ECI)</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>Entity Clarity Index (ECI)</strong> is a cross-industry analytical framework developed by
      <strong>exmxc.ai</strong> to evaluate how clearly institutions are interpreted by AI systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      ECI does <strong>not</strong> measure financial performance, popularity, or market success.
      It evaluates <em>structural interpretability</em> — whether AI systems can reliably reconstruct,
      contextualize, and trust an institution.
    </p>

    <h2>What ECI Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Posture</strong> — the institution’s strategic stance toward AI access and reuse</li>
      <li><strong>Capability</strong> — the structural ability of AI systems to discover and interpret the entity</li>
      <li><strong>Entity Clarity & Capability (ECC)</strong> — a composite interpretive signal derived from posture and capability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What ECI Is Not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ECI is <strong>not a ranking system</strong></li>
      <li>ECI does <strong>not compare performance across industries</strong></li>
      <li>ECI scores are <strong>not published outside official reports</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>PDF report is the authoritative record</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope & Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Each ECI report evaluates a single vertical to preserve interpretive integrity.
      Scores appear only within the context of the report itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      ECI operates as a standards discipline within exmxc.ai’s Institutional Strategy Framework
      and is governed by the principles of Entity Engineering.
