  <h1>Entity Engineering</h1>
  <p><strong>Structural Clarity & AI Interpretation</strong></p>

  <p>
    Entity Engineering is the structural discipline inside <strong>exmxc.ai</strong>’s Institutional Strategy Framework.
    It defines how institutions become legible, trusted, and durable inside AI systems — where visibility is no longer
    earned through keywords, but through structural clarity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Standards Lab establishes the principles, methods, and evaluative signals by which AI systems recognize,
    reconstruct, and trust institutions.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Measure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Entity clarity</strong> — how completely AI systems can reconstruct who you are and what you do.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural alignment</strong> — whether architecture, schema, and content resolve into a unified entity graph.</li>
    <li><strong>Signal consistency</strong> — whether identity patterns are stable across surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretive trust</strong> — whether AI systems treat the institution as reliable enough to cite or elevate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not a popularity measure.<br>
    It is a measure of institutional interpretability.
  </p>

  <h2>How Entity Engineering Works</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Entity Signals</strong><br>
      Structural signals used by AI models to classify and interpret institutions — including identity clarity,
      schema integrity, canonical discipline, and entity signatures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scoring & Interpretation Framework</strong><br>
      A tiered methodology that maps signals into interpretive bands — from fragmented entities to trusted,
      sovereign institutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-Surface Entity Review</strong><br>
      Human × AI reconstruction of how institutions are perceived across AI systems.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Measurement & Interpretation</h2>

  <p>
    Entity Engineering defines the structural discipline by which institutions become legible to AI systems.
    The <strong>Entity Clarity Index (ECI)</strong> is the formal measurement framework that evaluates how those
    structures are interpreted in practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Entity Engineering establishes the signals and standards, ECI assesses the resulting interpretive posture —
    whether an institution is reconstructed clearly, inconsistently, or not at all by AI systems.

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    In the AI-search era, institutions are not discovered — they are interpreted.
    Structural clarity determines whether an institution persists as a stable AI entity or collapses into noise.
