    <h1>Strategic Frameworks</h1>

    <p>
      exmxc.ai frameworks are long-horizon models used to interpret how AI reshapes
      institutional power, discovery, and competitive advantage.
      These are not thought pieces. They are structural maps.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The Four Forces of AI Power</h2>
      <p>
        A foundational framework describing how AI capability and influence
        concentrate across four forces: Compute, Interface, Alignment, and Energy.

    <section>
      <h2>Entity Engineering™</h2>
      <p>
        A framework for constructing entities that remain coherent, attributable,
        and durable when interpreted by AI systems.
